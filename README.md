#### Advertisement is a plague, here comes the doctor

This Web Audio API experiment aims at removing advertisement from web radios.
Through mathematical study of the sound, 
advertisement patterns are recognized and replaced with arbitrary content.
The project includes a unique radio player UI, client-side sound processing,
and server-side web radio metadata parsing.
